## üõ†Ô∏è Management Commands

Use the provided Makefile or run.sh script for easy management:

```bash
# Start all services
make start
# or
./run.sh start

# Check service status
make status
# or
./run.sh status

# View logs
make logs
# or
./run.sh logs

# Stop all services
make stop
# or

1. **Upload Image**: Drag and drop or click to upload a cosmetic product image
2. **Select Model**: Choose from DocTR, TrOCR, or MMOCR based on your needs
3. **Processing**: The system automatically:
   - Preprocesses the image (background removal, rotation, etc.)
   - Runs OCR using the selected model
   - Extracts text with bounding boxes
4. **Review Results**: View extracted text and annotated image
5. **AI Analysis**: Chat with GPT to analyze ingredients and get recommendations
6. **Export**: Download results as CSV for further analysis
